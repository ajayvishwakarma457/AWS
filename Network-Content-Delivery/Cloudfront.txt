Aws cloudfront provide me the key pointer which are best industry practice
  Here’s a professional, MNC-level summary of AWS CloudFront best practices 👇 —
  followed by cloud architects, DevOps engineers, and application delivery teams to ensure secure, performant, and cost-efficient global content delivery across AWS workloads.

🌎 1️⃣ Core Purpose & Architecture
  Amazon CloudFront is a global Content Delivery Network (CDN) that caches and delivers content (static, dynamic, video, API) from edge locations closest to users.
  Built on the AWS Global Edge Network — 600+ Points of Presence (PoPs) worldwide.
  Integrates deeply with S3, ALB, API Gateway, Lambda@Edge, and WAF.
  Reduces latency, improves performance, and offloads origin servers.
  💡 Think of CloudFront as your “global edge shield” for performance, security, and scalability.

⚙️ 2️⃣ Architecture & Deployment Design
  Use multiple origins (S3, ALB, API Gateway, or custom) for hybrid content delivery.
  Use Origin Groups for active-passive failover (high availability).
  Enable HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 (QUIC) for improved latency and efficiency.
  Compress objects automatically (GZIP or Brotli) to reduce size.
  Use edge caching for frequently accessed static and dynamic content.
  Set appropriate cache behaviors per path (e.g., /images/*, /api/*).
  Integrate Lambda@Edge or CloudFront Functions for lightweight edge logic (auth, headers, redirects).
  💡 Architecture = multiple origins + per-path optimization + edge compute.

🧠 3️⃣ Performance Optimization
  Use “Cache-Control” and “Expires” headers in origin responses to control TTL.
  Enable “Origin Shield” (regional caching layer) to reduce origin load.
  Tune TTLs:
    Static assets → long TTL (hours/days).
    Dynamic/API → short TTL (seconds/minutes).
  Use S3 Transfer Acceleration or CloudFront for faster uploads.
  Use CloudFront’s “Real-Time Metrics” to monitor cache hit ratio and latency.
  Minimize redirects and query parameters to improve cache efficiency.
  Pre-warm cache for known high-traffic events (product launches, marketing).
  💡 Performance = smart caching + compression + low-latency protocols.

🔒 4️⃣ Security Best Practices
  Use AWS WAF + AWS Shield Advanced for DDoS and web attack protection.
  Enable HTTPS (TLS 1.2/1.3) — redirect all HTTP to HTTPS.
  Use ACM-issued certificates (free, auto-renewing).
  Restrict S3 bucket access using Origin Access Identity (OAI) or Origin Access Control (OAC).
  Enable field-level encryption for sensitive data (PII).
  Use signed URLs or cookies to restrict content access.
  Integrate Lambda@Edge for token validation or IP whitelisting.
  Enable geo-restrictions if regulatory or licensing applies.
  Monitor WAF logs and CloudFront access logs for anomaly detection.
  💡 Security = encryption + restricted origin + defense-in-depth.

📊 5️⃣ Monitoring & Observability
  Enable CloudFront Access Logs (store in S3, analyze with Athena).
  Enable Real-Time Metrics (1-second granularity) in CloudWatch.
  Monitor key metrics:
    4xxErrorRate / 5xxErrorRate
    BytesDownloaded / Requests
    CacheHitRate
  Set CloudWatch Alarms for error rate and origin health.
  Use AWS CloudTrail to track configuration changes.
  Integrate with AWS Security Hub for compliance visibility.
  Use CloudWatch dashboards for performance analytics.
  💡 Visibility = logs + metrics + alerts + audit trails.

🧩 6️⃣ Integration with AWS Services
  | Service                                | Integration Purpose                           |
  | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
  | **S3**                                 | Static content origin with OAC/OAI protection |
  | **ALB / NLB**                          | Dynamic backend routing                       |
  | **API Gateway**                        | Accelerated global API delivery               |
  | **Lambda@Edge / CloudFront Functions** | Custom logic at edge (auth, routing)          |
  | **WAF / Shield**                       | Web security and DDoS protection              |
  | **Route 53**                           | Custom domain and geo-DNS routing             |
  | **Kinesis / CloudWatch**               | Log analysis and monitoring                   |
  | **ACM**                                | Free SSL/TLS certificates                     |
  💡 CloudFront sits at the edge of your entire AWS ecosystem.

💾 7️⃣ Cost Optimization
  Cache more, transfer less:
    Optimize Cache-Control headers to maximize cache hit ratio.
    Use Origin Shield to reduce redundant requests.
  Use CloudFront edge locations near your major user base.
  Use AWS Cost Explorer → CloudFront Usage Reports for tracking.
  Leverage free data transfer from AWS origins (S3/ALB/API Gateway → CloudFront).
  Avoid excessive invalidations — batch paths or use wildcard invalidations.
  Compress and minify assets before upload to reduce egress size.
  Tag CloudFront distributions (Environment, App, Owner) for cost reporting.
  💡 Optimization = caching, compression, and batching requests.

🧮 8️⃣ Automation & Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
  Define CloudFront distributions via CloudFormation, Terraform, or AWS CDK.
  Automate cache invalidations with EventBridge or CI/CD pipelines.
  Version-control all configurations (origins, behaviors, WAF rules).
  Use Lambda@Edge + IaC for global rule enforcement.
  Implement automated health checks and blue-green origin deployments.
  Integrate CloudFront deployment with CodePipeline for zero-downtime rollouts.
  💡 IaC = consistency + automation + governance.

🧰 9️⃣ Governance & Compliance
  Tag all distributions and origins (App, Environment, Compliance).
  Enable CloudTrail and Config rules (cloudfront-distribution-https-only, etc.).
  Restrict IAM permissions for modifying CloudFront configurations.
  Use WAF managed rule sets for compliance (OWASP, PCI-DSS, HIPAA).
  Enable field-level encryption for PII or financial data.
  Use AWS Audit Manager for evidence collection and compliance tracking.
  Enable geo-restriction for region-specific data protection laws (GDPR).
  💡 Governance = tagging + encryption + compliance visibility.

⚡ 10️⃣ Disaster Recovery & High Availability
  Use multiple origins in different Regions with failover routing.
  Enable health checks for primary and secondary origins.
  Replicate S3 data across Regions (CRR) for redundancy.
  Automate CloudFront distribution updates via IaC.
  Test failover and invalidation workflows regularly.
  💡 Resilience = multi-origin + health monitoring + automated failover.
