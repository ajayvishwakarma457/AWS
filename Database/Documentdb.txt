Aws documentdb provide me the key pointer which are best industry practice
  Excellent — here’s your industry-level summary of AWS DocumentDB best practices, designed the same way AWS-certified architects and database engineers follow them 👇

🧠 1️⃣ Architecture & Deployment
  Use Multi-AZ clusters for high availability — DocumentDB automatically maintains 6 copies of your data across 3 Availability Zones.
  Distribute read replicas across AZs to scale reads and increase resilience.
  Choose the right instance size (db.r6g or db.t4g for cost-effective workloads).
  Keep data close to your applications — deploy DocumentDB in the same region as your app servers.
  Use cluster endpoints effectively:
    Cluster endpoint → for writes
    Reader endpoint → for automatic load balancing of reads

🔒 2️⃣ Security Best Practices
  Deploy DocumentDB in private subnets — no public access for production workloads.
  Use AWS KMS to enable encryption at rest (default).
  Use SSL/TLS to enforce encryption in transit.
  Restrict inbound traffic using VPC security groups (allow only trusted EC2s or Lambda).
  Use IAM database authentication instead of username/password when possible.
  Store secrets (usernames, passwords, connection strings) in AWS Secrets Manager.
  Enable audit logging (to CloudWatch Logs) for compliance and tracking changes.

⚙️ 3️⃣ Performance Optimization
  Use appropriate indexes — compound and TTL indexes where needed.
  Monitor slow queries using the profiler and Performance Insights (if enabled).
  Optimize queries by using projections (return only necessary fields).
  Batch write/read operations instead of many small ones to reduce latency.
  Use connection pooling (e.g., via RDS Proxy or in-app libraries) to avoid overhead.
  Leverage read replicas to offload heavy read operations.
  Monitor metrics like CPUUtilization, FreeableMemory, DatabaseConnections, and ReadIOPS.

💾 4️⃣ Backup & Recovery
  Enable automated backups (default 1–35 days retention).
  Take manual snapshots before major schema or configuration changes.
  Use point-in-time restore (PITR) to recover to any second within the backup window.
  Store snapshots cross-region for disaster recovery (DR).
  Regularly test restoration to ensure backup integrity.

📊 5️⃣ Monitoring & Observability
  Use CloudWatch metrics and create alarms for CPU, connections, and storage usage.
  Enable Enhanced Monitoring for deeper visibility into performance.
  Stream logs to CloudWatch Logs for query profiling and auditing.
  Use AWS CloudTrail to track administrative operations (create, modify, delete clusters).
  Set up AWS Trusted Advisor checks for security and performance recommendations.

🧩 6️⃣ Maintenance & Upgrades
  Apply minor version upgrades during maintenance windows to stay secure and stable.
  Schedule maintenance windows during off-peak business hours.
  Test application compatibility before upgrading.
  Use parameter groups for consistent configuration across clusters.
  Automate maintenance and snapshot retention with AWS Backup policies.

💸 7️⃣ Cost Optimization
  Right-size your instances — avoid over-provisioning compute and storage.
  Use Reserved Instances (1 or 3 years) to save up to 70%.
  Scale read replicas dynamically based on workload.
  Delete idle clusters (test/dev environments) when not in use.
  Use tagging (e.g., Environment: Dev/Prod) for cost allocation and reporting.
  Monitor I/O usage — optimize queries to minimize unnecessary reads/writes.

🧰 8️⃣ Operational Best Practices
  Automate provisioning and management using AWS CloudFormation or Terraform.
  Use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for version-controlled cluster setup.
  Enable deletion protection to prevent accidental data loss.
  Test failovers regularly to validate high availability configuration.
  Implement CloudWatch dashboards for real-time cluster visibility.

🚀 9️⃣ DocumentDB-Specific Features to Leverage  
  | Feature                       | Benefit                                       |
