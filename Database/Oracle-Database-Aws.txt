Aws oracle database aws provide me the key pointer which are best industry practice
  Here’s a professional, enterprise-grade summary of AWS Oracle Database best practices 👇 — aligned with how large organizations (banks, healthcare, SaaS, etc.) run Oracle workloads reliably and cost-effectively on AWS.

🧠 1️⃣ Architecture & Deployment
  Choose the right deployment model:
    Amazon RDS for Oracle → fully managed, best for general enterprise workloads.
    Oracle on EC2 → self-managed, best for legacy apps or custom configurations.
  Use Multi-AZ (RDS) or Data Guard (EC2) for high availability.
  Deploy in private subnets (no public access).
  Use DB subnet groups with subnets in multiple AZs for fault tolerance.
  Co-locate application servers and Oracle DB in the same region/VPC to minimize latency.
  Use Oracle Enterprise Edition if you need advanced features (RAC, Partitioning, TDE).
  💡 Pick RDS for managed simplicity, EC2 for custom control.

🔒 2️⃣ Security Best Practices
  Keep database private — never expose Oracle DB to the public internet.
  Encrypt data at rest (KMS integration or Oracle TDE).
  Encrypt data in transit using SSL/TLS for JDBC and SQL*Net connections.
  Use IAM authentication (for RDS) instead of storing passwords in code.
  Restrict network access using Security Groups (allow only app-tier traffic).
  Store credentials in AWS Secrets Manager, not in application configs.
  Enable Oracle audit logging (DB audit, fine-grained audit).
  Monitor changes via AWS CloudTrail for RDS management actions.
  💡 Follow the principle of least privilege for both AWS and Oracle users.

⚙️ 3️⃣ Performance Optimization
  Use Oracle Automatic Workload Repository (AWR) and Automatic Database Diagnostic Monitor (ADDM) to identify bottlenecks.
  Enable Performance Insights (for RDS) for query-level metrics.
  Right-size instance class based on CPU, IOPS, and memory.
  Use Provisioned IOPS (io1/io2) for I/O-intensive workloads.
  Leverage Oracle Optimizer Hints for complex queries.
  Index frequently queried columns, but avoid over-indexing.
  Partition large tables to improve read/write efficiency.
  Use connection pooling (e.g., via RDS Proxy, or in app layer).
  Monitor CloudWatch metrics — ReadIOPS, WriteIOPS, FreeStorage, DBLoad.
  💡 Optimize SQL and storage before scaling hardware.

💾 4️⃣ Backup & Recovery
  Enable automated backups (RDS default, retention up to 35 days).
  Use Oracle RMAN (for EC2 deployments) for manual or custom backups.
  Store backups in S3 for long-term archival.
  Enable Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR) for RDS.
  Take manual snapshots before upgrades or schema changes.
  Test restore operations periodically.
  For EC2 → use EBS snapshots for instance-level backup automation.
  💡 Backups + tested restores = true reliability.

📊 5️⃣ Monitoring & Observability
  Use Amazon CloudWatch for database metrics (CPU, memory, IOPS, storage).
  Enable Enhanced Monitoring for OS-level metrics (RDS).
  Integrate with Oracle Enterprise Manager (OEM) for deep performance and query analysis.
  Enable Performance Insights to track query latency.
  Set CloudWatch alarms for CPU > 80%, FreeStorage < 10%, or connection spikes.
  Enable CloudTrail to monitor administrative API calls.
  Export Oracle logs to CloudWatch Logs for centralized analysis.
  💡 Combine Oracle tools (AWR, OEM) + AWS tools (CloudWatch, Insights) for full visibility.

🧩 6️⃣ Maintenance & Upgrades
  Schedule maintenance windows during off-peak hours.
  Enable auto minor version upgrades for patching security vulnerabilities.
  Use Oracle Data Guard / Active Data Guard for rolling upgrades (on EC2).
  For RDS → apply upgrades via AWS Console or CLI with snapshot safety.
  Test upgrades in staging before applying to production.
  Regularly rebuild indexes and gather optimizer statistics.
  💡 Regular maintenance keeps Oracle stable and performant.

💸 7️⃣ Cost Optimization
  Right-size instances — avoid over-provisioning vCPUs and storage.
  Use Reserved Instances (1-3 years) for long-running workloads (up to 70% savings).
  Use General Purpose SSD (gp3) for medium workloads, Provisioned IOPS for heavy I/O.
  Move cold data to S3 (via Oracle Data Pump or partitioning) to reduce storage cost.
  Stop non-production RDS instances when not in use.
  Tag resources (Environment, App, Owner) for cost tracking.
  Monitor CloudWatch metrics to tune capacity usage.
  💡 Most Oracle cost savings come from right-sizing + reservations.

🧰 8️⃣ Operational Best Practices
  Automate provisioning with CloudFormation, Terraform, or AWS CDK.
  Enable deletion protection for production databases.
  Use multiple environments (Dev, Staging, Prod) with isolated VPCs.
  Implement health checks and failover drills quarterly.
  Apply role-based access control for DBAs and DevOps teams.
  Document runbooks for backup, recovery, and failover procedures.
  💡 Automation + documentation = resilience.

🚀 9️⃣ Integration & Use Cases
  | Integration                          | Best Practice                                |
  | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
  | **EC2 / Lambda / ECS**               | Connect via private subnets with SSL/TLS.    |
  | **S3**                               | Use for backups (RMAN, Data Pump exports).   |
  | **DMS (Database Migration Service)** | For migrating from on-prem or other RDBMS.   |
  | **CloudWatch / QuickSight**          | For performance visualization and analytics. |
  | **Secrets Manager**                  | Manage Oracle credentials securely.          |
  | **AWS Backup**                       | Centralize RDS and EC2-based Oracle backups. |
