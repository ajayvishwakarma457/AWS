🧱 1. Repository Organization
  ✅ Use environment-based repositories – e.g.,
    appname/dev, appname/staging, appname/prod
  ✅ Use microservice-based repos – e.g.,
    moviu-api, kaay-frontend, auth-service
  🚫 Avoid generic names like test, repo1, or default.


🔐 2. Access Control (IAM & Permissions)
  ✅ Use IAM roles and policies for granular access control.
    Example: Allow push only for CI/CD roles, pull for ECS/EKS services.
  ✅ Avoid using root credentials for authentication.
  ✅ Use temporary credentials via AWS STS or ECR login with get-login-password.


🧩 3. Image Tagging Strategy
  ✅ Always use semantic or descriptive tags:
    v1.0.0, v1.0.1, staging-2025-10-11, commit-<sha>
  ✅ Also keep a latest tag for convenience but don’t depend solely on it.
  🚫 Avoid overwriting tags (can cause version confusion in deployments).


🧼 4. Lifecycle Policies
  ✅ Configure lifecycle rules to automatically delete old/unreferenced images.
    Example: Keep only the last 10 versions or last 30 days.
  ✅ Helps save costs and keep the registry clean.

🔒 5. Image Security Scanning
  ✅ Enable ECR image scan on push to detect vulnerabilities (CVE, etc.).
  ✅ Regularly review scan reports and fix base image issues.
  ✅ Integrate security checks in your CI/CD pipeline.

🚀 6. CI/CD Integration
  ✅ Automate docker build, tag, and push with GitHub Actions / CodePipeline.
  ✅ Use build metadata in tags:
    Example: app:v1.2.3-<commit-hash>-<build-number>
  ✅ Automate cleanup and deploy from ECR to ECS/EKS/App Runner.

🌍 7. Cross-Region & Cross-Account Access
  ✅ Use ECR replication for multi-region deployments (for faster pull & HA).
  ✅ For multi-account setups, use ECR cross-account policies.

📊 8. Monitoring & Cost Management
  ✅ Enable CloudWatch metrics for ECR: image count, pull/push count, storage size.
  ✅ Use AWS Trusted Advisor or Cost Explorer to optimize storage.
  ✅ Delete unused repos periodically.

🧱 9. Base Image Management
  ✅ Use trusted base images (e.g., node:18-alpine, python:3.11-slim).
  ✅ Keep base images updated regularly to patch vulnerabilities.

🧰 10. Performance Optimization
  ✅ Prefer smaller images (alpine, multi-stage builds).
  ✅ Compress build context and .dockerignore unnecessary files.
  ✅ Use ECR caching for CI builds to reduce build times.
