Aws efs provide me the key pointer which are best industry practice.
  Here’s a professional, industry-grade summary of AWS EFS (Elastic File System) best practices 👇 —
  followed by cloud engineers, architects, and DevOps teams to ensure secure, scalable, and cost-optimized shared file storage across AWS workloads.

🧠 1️⃣ Architecture & Design Principles
  EFS = Fully managed, elastic, NFS-based shared file system — ideal for Linux-based EC2, ECS, EKS, Lambda, and on-prem applications.
  Scales automatically — no provisioning or resizing needed.
  Provides multi-AZ availability within a Region.
  Use Regional EFS for HA workloads and One Zone EFS for cost-sensitive or non-critical data.
  Separate EFS file systems per application or environment (e.g., app-prod-efs, app-dev-efs).
  Choose performance mode based on workload:
    General Purpose → default; good for web, content, and CMS workloads.
    Max I/O → highly parallelized (big data, analytics).
  💡 EFS is built for shared, concurrent access and elastic scaling.

🔒 2️⃣ Security Best Practices
  Encrypt all data at rest using AWS KMS (EFS supports encryption by default).
  Encrypt data in transit (TLS) by enabling enforce-in-transit option.
  Control access using IAM + Security Groups + NFS permissions.
  Use EFS Access Points for app-specific directory isolation and permissions.
  Disable root access where unnecessary — enforce user-based permissions.
  Mount EFS only in private subnets (no direct public internet access).
  Restrict NFS port (2049) in Security Groups — allow access only from trusted instances.
  Monitor access using AWS CloudTrail and EFS Access Logs.
  Integrate with AWS Macie for sensitive data detection (if storing regulated data).
  💡 Security = private networking + least-privilege NFS access + encryption.

⚙️ 3️⃣ Networking & Mount Targets
  Create mount targets in each AZ where EC2/ECS/EKS instances reside — for high availability.
  Use Security Groups to control NFS access (port 2049) from only necessary resources.
  Place EFS and compute in the same VPC for minimal latency.
  Use DNS names (fs-xxxx.efs.<region>.amazonaws.com) for automatic endpoint management.
  For hybrid setups, connect on-prem via AWS Direct Connect or VPN.
  Enable VPC Flow Logs for network-level visibility.
  💡 Proper mount target setup ensures high availability and low latency.

💾 4️⃣ Performance Optimization
  Choose the right throughput mode:
    Bursting (default) → automatically scales up/down with usage.
    Provisioned → fixed performance, for consistent heavy workloads.
  Use “Elastic Throughput” for unpredictable workloads (automatically adjusts).
  Distribute I/O evenly across files and directories to maximize throughput.
  Use EFS Access Points for concurrent, multi-user applications.
  Use General Purpose performance for latency-sensitive apps.
  Leverage caching at the application level (e.g., Redis, CloudFront) for frequent reads.
  Enable Amazon CloudWatch metrics (PercentIOBurstCreditBalance) to monitor performance.
  💡 Match throughput and performance modes to workload behavior.

🧩 5️⃣ Data Management
  Enable Lifecycle Management — automatically move infrequently accessed files to EFS Infrequent Access (EFS-IA) after X days.
  Use EFS Intelligent Tiering to optimize cost dynamically between Standard and IA.
  Tag file systems (App, Environment, Owner, CostCenter) for visibility.
  Implement directory-level structure (e.g., /app/data, /app/logs) for logical separation.
  Back up critical data with AWS Backup (EFS is fully integrated).
  Enable file versioning and retention policies via application logic.
  Monitor storage growth via CloudWatch and EFS metrics.
  💡 Lifecycle + tagging + automation = clean and cost-efficient file storage.

🧰 6️⃣ Integration with Other AWS Services
  | Service                 | Use Case                                              |
  | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
  | **EC2 / ECS / EKS**     | Shared file storage across multiple compute instances |
  | **Lambda**              | Stateful workloads and persistent file storage        |
  | **AWS Backup**          | Centralized backup management                         |
  | **DataSync**            | Move data to/from S3 or on-prem NFS                   |
  | **CloudWatch**          | Monitor performance and usage metrics                 |
  | **CloudTrail**          | Log API operations for compliance                     |
  | **AWS Transfer Family** | SFTP/FTP file access integration                      |

📊 7️⃣ Monitoring & Observability
  Enable CloudWatch Metrics:
    BurstCreditBalance
    IOUtilization
    PercentIOBurstCreditBalance
    DataReadIOBytes / DataWriteIOBytes
  Enable CloudWatch Alarms for performance or capacity thresholds.
  Enable CloudTrail for audit of configuration changes.
  Use AWS Config rules (e.g., efs-encrypted-check) to ensure compliance.
  Set alarms for mount target health and IO throttling.
  Visualize usage with CloudWatch Dashboards or Grafana.
  💡 Proactive monitoring ensures uptime and performance stability.

💸 8️⃣ Cost Optimization
  Enable Lifecycle Management to transition old files to EFS-IA automatically.
  Use Intelligent-Tiering to switch between Standard and IA based on access.
  Delete unused or stale file systems after validation.
  Monitor CloudWatch metrics for storage growth trends.
  Tag all EFS resources for chargeback and cost tracking.
  Evaluate One Zone EFS for non-critical workloads — up to 47% cheaper.
  Use compression at the application level where possible.
  💡 Cost optimization = lifecycle policies + right storage class + tagging.

🧮 9️⃣ Backup & Recovery
  Use AWS Backup for automatic, policy-based backups of EFS.
  Store backups in separate vaults for isolation.
  Enable cross-Region or cross-account backups for DR.
  Perform periodic restore tests to validate RTO/RPO.
  Use Lifecycle policies + Backup together for hybrid cost + data protection.
  Monitor backup job success/failures in AWS Backup console.
  💡 Automate and test backups regularly — don’t rely on manual copies.

🧠 10️⃣ Governance & Compliance
  Enable encryption at rest (KMS) and enforce encryption in transit.
  Use AWS Config to detect unencrypted or public EFS mounts.
  Enable CloudTrail for full visibility of API and mount target changes.
  Apply tagging standards for resource accountability.
  Implement IAM boundaries and RBAC for EFS management.
  Integrate with AWS Security Hub for compliance checks.
  Regularly review Security Group and NACL configurations.
