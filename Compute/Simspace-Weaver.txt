Aws simspace weaver provide me the key pointer which are best industry practice.
  Here’s a professional, enterprise-grade summary of AWS SimSpace Weaver best practices 👇 —
  used by simulation engineers, digital twin developers, defense contractors, and large-scale modeling teams for running massive, distributed, real-time simulations on AWS.

🧠 1️⃣ Architecture & Design Principles
  Understand SimSpace Weaver’s purpose: it’s built to run spatial simulations at scale — such as smart cities, autonomous vehicles, defense systems, or crowd simulations.
  Design your simulation as independent components (cells) that can be distributed across multiple compute nodes.
  Use AWS-managed orchestration — SimSpace Weaver automatically partitions, distributes, and synchronizes simulation state.
  Keep your simulation logic modular and stateless per tick (each simulation step).
  Use Amazon ECS or EKS for containerized compute to run your simulation workers.
  Separate simulation logic, data ingestion, and visualization layers.
  💡 Architecture = distributed, modular, and decoupled — designed for horizontal scaling.

⚙️ 2️⃣ Simulation Model Design
  Partition spatial data logically — divide your world into “cells” or “regions” for scalable parallelism.
  Avoid overloading a single cell — design balanced spatial distribution to prevent bottlenecks.
  Use consistent update intervals (simulation ticks) across all regions for deterministic results.
  Decouple simulation engine from visualization/clients — use messaging or APIs.
  Store simulation state externally (e.g., DynamoDB, S3) for persistence or recovery.
  Use AWS Step Functions or EventBridge to manage complex simulation flows.
  💡 A well-partitioned model ensures scalability and synchronization.

🔒 3️⃣ Security Best Practices
  Run simulations in private subnets — isolate from public internet.
  Use IAM roles with least privilege for simulation apps, ECS tasks, and visualization clients.
  Encrypt all simulation data in transit (TLS) and at rest (KMS).
  Use Amazon VPC Security Groups and NACLs to restrict network traffic between simulation components.
  Authenticate API endpoints (AppSync, API Gateway, or custom REST) with Cognito or IAM.
  Enable CloudTrail and Config to audit simulation launches, modifications, and data access.
  Integrate AWS Shield / WAF for public visualization portals or dashboards.
  💡 Hybrid security = IAM + encryption + private networking.

💾 4️⃣ Data Management & Persistence
  Use Amazon S3 for storing input datasets, simulation configurations, and output results.
  Use DynamoDB for storing dynamic simulation metadata and runtime states.
  Store logs and metrics in CloudWatch Logs or OpenSearch for real-time analysis.
  Use S3 Lifecycle Policies to manage large output data retention and archival.
  Use AWS Glue or Athena for post-simulation data analysis.
  Integrate Kinesis or Kafka (MSK) for streaming live simulation data to dashboards or analytics systems.
  💡 Data lifecycle management prevents storage bloat and speeds up analysis.

📊 5️⃣ Monitoring & Observability
  Enable Amazon CloudWatch metrics for ECS/EKS tasks, network traffic, and CPU/memory usage.
  Use CloudWatch Logs for simulation tick logs and error traces.
  Integrate AWS X-Ray or OpenTelemetry for distributed performance tracing.
  Use custom metrics for simulation state — e.g., tick time, object count, region load.
  Set CloudWatch Alarms for simulation stalls, CPU saturation, or network lag.
  Visualize performance trends using Grafana or QuickSight dashboards.
  💡 Visibility is key — monitor both infrastructure and simulation behavior.

🧩 6️⃣ Compute & Scaling
  Use ECS Fargate or EC2 with Auto Scaling to dynamically scale simulation workers.
  Leverage SimSpace Weaver’s automatic partitioning for distributing compute.
  Use placement groups (cluster type) for latency-sensitive simulations.
  Right-size container resources (CPU/memory) per simulation cell.
  Run tests to benchmark scale limits before production.
  Distribute workload across multiple AZs for fault tolerance.
  💡 Dynamic compute scaling keeps performance steady as simulation complexity grows.

🔁 7️⃣ Integration with Other AWS Services
  | Service                   | Integration Use Case                        |
  | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
  | **S3**                    | Input/output data storage                   |
  | **Kinesis / Kafka (MSK)** | Real-time event streaming                   |
  | **AppSync / API Gateway** | Simulation visualization or API endpoints   |
  | **CloudFront + S3**       | Web dashboards for simulation results       |
  | **ECS / EKS**             | Simulation container orchestration          |
  | **Lambda**                | Lightweight triggers or data transformation |
  | **Step Functions**        | Simulation workflow automation              |
  💡 Leverage native AWS integrations for full lifecycle automation.

💸 8️⃣ Cost Optimization
  Use Spot Instances for non-critical simulations or testing.
  Auto-scale ECS tasks to only run during active simulation periods.
  Shut down idle simulations automatically using EventBridge rules or Lambda.
  Store large output data in S3 Glacier for long-term archival.
  Right-size network and compute per region (avoid over-provisioning).
  Use AWS Budgets + Cost Explorer to monitor simulation runtime expenses.
  Reuse static data (maps, terrain, configurations) to avoid redundant storage.
  💡 Efficient scaling and data lifecycle policies minimize HPC costs.

🧮 9️⃣ Automation & CI/CD
  Use AWS CloudFormation / CDK / Terraform for deploying SimSpace Weaver projects.
  Automate simulation setup and teardown with Step Functions or Lambda.
  Integrate with AWS CodePipeline / CodeBuild for CI/CD of simulation code.
  Use Parameter Store for environment configurations.
  Automate test simulations on smaller grids before full-scale launch.
  Version control configurations and simulation code in Git.
  💡 Automation improves repeatability and reduces human error.

🧠 10️⃣ Governance & Compliance
  Use AWS Organizations + Control Tower for multi-account governance.
  Enable AWS Config to track environment drift and simulation configuration compliance.
  Use GuardDuty + Security Hub for hybrid security posture management.
  Apply tagging standards (Simulation, Environment, Project, Owner) for cost and access control.
  Use IAM Access Analyzer to detect overly permissive roles.
  Maintain audit logs (CloudTrail + S3) for all simulation and data events.
  Ensure compliance with data residency and export regulations if using real-world geospatial data.
  💡 Governance = tagging, auditing, compliance, and secure boundaries.
