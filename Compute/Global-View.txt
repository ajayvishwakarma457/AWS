Aws global view provide me the key pointer which are best industry practice
  Here’s a professional, industry-grade summary of AWS Global View best practices 👇 —
  AWS Global View (part of the AWS Management Console & AWS Config) enables multi-region visibility and control over resources across your entire AWS account or organization.
  These best practices are followed by enterprise DevOps, security, and cloud governance teams to maintain visibility, compliance, and security across all AWS regions.

🌍 1️⃣ Architecture & Purpose
  Global View provides a centralized dashboard for viewing resources across multiple AWS Regions.
  It’s ideal for multi-region architectures, compliance auditing, and security visibility.
  It integrates with AWS Config, Organizations, and CloudTrail to give a unified view.
  Use Global View in combination with AWS Control Tower, Security Hub, and Config Aggregators for full-stack governance.
  Restrict use to admin/operations roles — it displays account-wide sensitive configuration details.
  💡 Global View = single pane of glass for all AWS regions and services.

🔐 2️⃣ Security & Access Control
  Use IAM least-privilege policies — grant access only to users who need cross-region visibility.
  Enable AWS Organizations to aggregate resources from multiple accounts securely.
  Use AWS SSO / Identity Center for central authentication and MFA enforcement.
  Audit Global View actions using AWS CloudTrail (especially cross-region access).
  Enable AWS Config Aggregators with encryption (KMS) for data at rest.
  Never use root credentials to access Global View.
  Restrict visibility for sensitive regions (GovCloud, restricted environments) if not needed.
  💡 Secure access = IAM roles + MFA + CloudTrail logging.

⚙️ 3️⃣ Configuration & Setup Best Practices
  Enable AWS Config in all regions — Global View relies on Config data for inventory.
  Set up a centralized Config Aggregator to collect data from all accounts and regions.
  Enable global resources tracking in Config (e.g., IAM users, CloudFront).
  Use tagging standards to unify visibility (e.g., Environment, Owner, App).
  Enable AWS Trusted Advisor and Config Conformance Packs for compliance insights.
  Regularly review which regions are active — disable unused regions to minimize attack surface.
  💡 Full visibility comes from enabling Config and consistent tagging across all regions.

🧠 4️⃣ Governance & Compliance
  Centralize governance using AWS Organizations + Config Aggregators.
  Use AWS Security Hub Global Dashboard for unified compliance across regions.
  Enable AWS GuardDuty and Macie in all regions for threat detection and data protection.
  Use AWS Audit Manager with Config data for compliance frameworks (CIS, ISO, HIPAA).
  Regularly review Config Rules and non-compliant resources from Global View.
  Implement automatic remediation via Systems Manager or Lambda triggers for violations.
  💡 Governance = Config + Security Hub + GuardDuty + Automation.

📊 5️⃣ Monitoring & Observability
  Enable AWS CloudWatch cross-region dashboards for centralized monitoring.
  Enable CloudTrail multi-region logging for full activity traceability.
  Aggregate logs to a single S3 bucket (with prefix by region or account).
  Use AWS Config timelines to view configuration drift across regions.
  Use EventBridge for cross-region alerts (e.g., security group changes, instance creation).
  Integrate Global View data with Grafana or QuickSight for visualization.
  💡 Centralized logging + multi-region metrics = true observability.

💸 6️⃣ Cost & Resource Management
  Use AWS Cost Explorer + Budgets with tags for region-specific cost tracking.
  Disable inactive or unnecessary regions to reduce overhead.
  Use AWS Compute Optimizer globally to right-size resources in all regions.
  Consolidate S3 and CloudWatch Logs to one monitoring region to cut costs.
  Tag and group resources per region to easily identify under-utilized assets.
  Set automated cleanup for orphaned resources discovered in Global View.
  💡 Visibility drives accountability — use Global View to reduce regional waste.

🔁 7️⃣ Automation & Integration
  Use AWS CLI or SDK (boto3, AWS SDK for Node.js, etc.) to query Global View data programmatically.
  Automate resource inventory reports using AWS Config and EventBridge schedules.
  Integrate Global View data into dashboards (QuickSight, ServiceNow, Datadog, etc.).
  Trigger cross-region remediation workflows via Lambda or Step Functions.
  Combine with AWS Systems Manager Inventory for software-level visibility.
  💡 Automation transforms visibility into continuous compliance.

🧩 8️⃣ Multi-Account Management
  Use AWS Control Tower to standardize account setup, guardrails, and access.
  Set up Config Aggregators at the Organization level (not per account).
  Delegate admin accounts for centralized Config and Security Hub visibility.
  Use Organization-wide tagging policies for better cross-account filtering.
  Regularly audit account status and compliance posture via Global View.
  💡 Unified multi-account governance starts with centralized aggregation.

🧰 9️⃣ Maintenance & Audit Readiness
  Regularly validate Config Aggregator permissions (avoid stale roles or broken links).
  Rotate KMS keys used for Config data encryption.
  Review CloudTrail logs for unusual cross-region activity.
  Maintain documentation for regions enabled, Config rules, and tagging standards.
  Export Global View reports quarterly for audit and compliance review.
  Integrate with AWS Audit Manager to generate automated evidence packages.
  💡 Continuous auditing ensures compliance and operational integrity.

🚀 10️⃣ Scalability & Future-Readiness
  Enable new AWS regions deliberately — follow security onboarding checklist.
  Replicate Config and Security Hub data automatically to new regions.
  Train teams on interpreting Global View and Config dashboards.
  Use AWS Organizations service control policies (SCPs) to standardize new account setups.
  Plan for global failover strategies — use Global View insights to simulate recovery readiness.
  💡 Global readiness = observability, security, and controlled expansion.
