AWS Lightsail provide me the key pointer which are best industry practice

Here are the best industry-standard practices and key pointers when working with AWS Lightsail — especially if you’re using it for small- to medium-scale applications, 
staging, or early-stage production before scaling up to EC2 or ECS.

🧱 1. Architecture & Planning
  Use Lightsail for simplified workloads — such as MVPs, prototypes, blogs, or single-tier web apps — not for complex multi-tier systems.
  Define clear upgrade path: plan migration to EC2/ECS/RDS when your compute, scaling, or networking requirements grow.
  Use Availability Zones wisely: launch instances and databases in the same region/AZ to reduce latency.

⚙️ 2. Compute Instance Practices
  Choose the right blueprint (e.g., Ubuntu + Node.js, WordPress, etc.) instead of building from scratch every time.
  Use static IPs for all public-facing instances — ensures DNS consistency after restarts.
  Enable automatic snapshots daily or weekly to protect against data loss.
  Use SSH Key Pairs securely — generate locally and never expose private keys.

🧰 3. Networking & Security
  Use Lightsail Networking tab to configure:
    Static IP — attach to instance.
    DNS Zone — manage domain mapping.
    Firewall rules (networking) — only open required ports (e.g., 22 SSH, 80 HTTP, 443 HTTPS).
  Enforce HTTPS:
    Use Lightsail Load Balancer and attach free AWS SSL certificates, or
    Configure Let’s Encrypt manually on your instance.
  Use VPC Peering if you integrate with AWS services outside Lightsail (like S3, RDS, Lambda).

💾 4. Storage & Databases
    Use separate Lightsail database instances (MySQL/PostgreSQL) instead of installing DB on same VM — better performance and easier scaling.
    Enable automatic backups for DB instances and test restore regularly.
    Attach block storage volumes instead of increasing instance size when you just need more disk.

📈 5. Scaling & Performance
    Start small (e.g., $5 plan) and monitor CPU/RAM.
    Add a Lightsail Load Balancer when adding multiple app instances — supports sticky sessions and SSL termination.
    Cache static content using Lightsail CDN Distribution (CloudFront-powered) — reduces latency and bandwidth costs.

🧩 6. Monitoring & Maintenance
  Enable metrics and notifications:
    Use Lightsail monitoring graphs (CPU, network, disk).
    Integrate with CloudWatch for advanced alerting via SNS.
  Automate patching: run OS updates periodically or use scripts (cron jobs).
  Use snapshots before making critical changes (deployment, upgrade).

🧾 7. Cost & Optimization
    Use predictable monthly plans (Lightsail bundles) — includes instance, bandwidth, static IP, DNS.
    Monitor bandwidth usage — plan has a cap; beyond that, extra data is billed.
    Delete unused static IPs, snapshots, and test instances to avoid hidden costs.

🧰 8. Integration & Migration Best Practices
    Integrate with S3 for large file storage or backups.
    Use CloudFront CDN for production-grade content delivery.
    When ready to scale, use “Create EC2 instance from snapshot” feature — seamless migration from Lightsail to EC2.

🛡️ 9. Security Checklist
  ✅ Restrict SSH access (22) to your IP only.
  ✅ Use IAM roles for any AWS API access (via AWS CLI or SDK).
  ✅ Rotate access keys regularly.
  ✅ Enable HTTPS + automatic renewal.
  ✅ Enable CloudWatch alarms for CPU spikes or failures.

🧭 10. Typical Industry Use Cases
  | Use Case                              | Lightsail Advantage                    |
  | :------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------- |
  | Startup MVP Deployment                | Fixed cost, quick setup                |
  | WordPress Hosting                     | Pre-configured LAMP stack              |
  | Single-Region API Backend             | Low-cost compute + static IP           |
  | Staging/Testing Environment           | Isolated, easy to destroy and recreate |
  | Educational Projects / Portfolio Apps | Simple UI and billing                  |
