Aws ec2 provide me the key pointer which are best industry practice
  Here’s a professional, industry-level summary of AWS EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) best practices 👇 —
  These are followed by top cloud teams (Netflix, Airbnb, and AWS partners) for security, reliability, performance, and cost optimization.

🧠 1️⃣ Architecture & Deployment Design
    Use the right instance type for the workload:
      t or m → general purpose
      c → compute-optimized
      r → memory-optimized
      g → GPU-based
  Distribute instances across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) for high availability.
  Use Auto Scaling Groups (ASG) for elasticity — add or remove instances based on demand.
  Attach Elastic Load Balancers (ALB/NLB) for traffic distribution.
  Deploy inside private subnets for backend workloads; use public subnets only for front-end or bastion hosts.
  Tag all instances (Environment, Owner, Application) for tracking and automation.
  💡 Architecture = scalable + redundant + properly isolated.

🔒 2️⃣ Security Best Practices
  Use IAM roles for EC2 — never hardcode AWS credentials.
  Restrict SSH access with Security Groups (only from specific IPs or bastion host).
  Disable password-based SSH — use SSH key pairs or Systems Manager Session Manager.
  Keep the OS and software patched (enable SSM Patch Manager).
  Use VPC security layers:
    Security Groups → instance-level.
    Network ACLs → subnet-level.
  Encrypt data at rest (EBS, S3) and in transit (TLS).
  Enable GuardDuty and Inspector for vulnerability and intrusion detection.
  Use AWS Secrets Manager for credentials, not environment files.
  Turn on detailed monitoring and CloudTrail logs for activity tracking.
  💡 Least privilege, encryption, and restricted access are core pillars.

⚙️ 3️⃣ Performance Optimization
  Use EBS-optimized instances for consistent storage performance.
  Choose appropriate EBS volume types:
    gp3 → general use SSD
    io2 → high IOPS workloads
    st1/sc1 → throughput or archival storage
  Use Elastic Network Adapters (ENA) for high network throughput.
  Use Amazon CloudWatch metrics (CPUUtilization, NetworkIn/Out, DiskIOPS) to detect bottlenecks.
  Use Placement Groups for low-latency, tightly coupled workloads.
  Enable Enhanced Networking (SR-IOV) for heavy network workloads.
  Leverage Auto Scaling to handle unpredictable load spikes.
  💡 Optimize compute, network, and storage — monitor continuously.

💾 4️⃣ Backup & Recovery
  Use Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) for consistent instance replication.
  Automate EBS snapshots via Data Lifecycle Manager (DLM).
  Store AMIs and snapshots in multiple regions for disaster recovery.
  Use Elastic IPs for static endpoints across instance replacements.
  Use Auto Scaling with Launch Templates to recover failed instances automatically.
  Integrate with AWS Backup for centralized backup management.
  💡 Automate backups and design for failure — not uptime assumptions.

📊 5️⃣ Monitoring & Observability
  Use CloudWatch Alarms for CPU, memory, and disk metrics.
  Enable CloudWatch Agent to collect detailed OS metrics and logs.
  Aggregate application logs using CloudWatch Logs or OpenSearch.
  Enable CloudTrail to track EC2 API activity.
  Set up AWS Config rules to enforce compliance (e.g., encryption enabled).
  Use AWS Systems Manager OpsCenter for operational insights.
  💡 Proactive monitoring prevents outages and security drift.

🧩 6️⃣ Networking Best Practices
  Use VPC endpoints for private AWS service access (no Internet traffic).
  Deploy a Bastion Host in public subnet for SSH access — never expose all instances.
  Use Elastic Load Balancers (ALB/NLB) for HA and scalability.
  Enable VPC Flow Logs for network visibility.
  Apply Security Groups per role (e.g., web, DB, admin).
  Use Transit Gateway or VPC Peering for cross-VPC communication.
  💡 Well-structured networking improves security, speed, and control.

🧰 7️⃣ Maintenance & Patching
  Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to automate OS and app updates.
  Schedule regular maintenance windows (non-business hours).
  Monitor instance health checks for ASG replacement.
  Keep AMIs updated with security patches.
  Rotate SSH keys and IAM roles regularly.
  Use EventBridge rules for automated patching or restart alerts.
  💡 Consistent patching = stable + compliant systems.

💸 8️⃣ Cost Optimization
  Use right-sizing recommendations (AWS Compute Optimizer).
  Use Spot Instances for stateless or fault-tolerant workloads (up to 90% savings).
  Use Reserved Instances / Savings Plans for steady workloads (up to 70% savings).
  Stop or terminate idle instances automatically using Lambda or SSM Automation.
  Use gp3 instead of gp2 volumes (cheaper and customizable IOPS).
  Monitor cost via AWS Cost Explorer and Budgets.
  Enable detailed billing with tags for accountability.
  💡 Pay for what you need — automate shutdowns and size correctly.

🧮 9️⃣ Automation & Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
  Use CloudFormation / Terraform / CDK for consistent EC2 deployments.
  Automate configuration using AWS Systems Manager State Manager or Ansible.
  Use Launch Templates (not old Launch Configurations) for version control.
  Automate scaling and deployment via CI/CD pipelines (CodePipeline, Jenkins).
  Leverage user data scripts to bootstrap instances at launch.
  💡 Automation = reliability, repeatability, and faster delivery.

🧠 10️⃣ Governance & Compliance
  Use AWS Config + Security Hub for compliance monitoring.
  Enable GuardDuty + Inspector for threat detection and vulnerability scanning.
  Use Control Tower / Organizations for multi-account governance.
  Enforce policies via Service Control Policies (SCPs).
  Audit and rotate IAM roles and keys.
  Maintain AMI and patch version baselines.
  💡 Governance ensures continuous security and operational consistency.

🚀 TL;DR — AWS EC2 Golden Rules
  Private, multi-AZ, IAM-controlled architecture.
  Use Auto Scaling, Load Balancing, and Health Checks for resilience.
  Encrypt everything — data, volumes, traffic.
  Monitor via CloudWatch + CloudTrail + Config.
  Automate backups, patching, and scaling.
  Optimize cost using right-sizing, Spot, and lifecycle automation.
  Use IaC for consistency and compliance.
  Apply least privilege and network segmentation always.
