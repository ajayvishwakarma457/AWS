Aws Secrets Manager provide me the key pointer which are best industry practice
  Here’s a professional, enterprise-level summary of AWS Secrets Manager best practices 👇 —
  followed by DevSecOps engineers, cloud architects, and compliance teams to ensure secure credential storage, automatic rotation, and least-privilege access across AWS environments.

🧠 1️⃣ Core Purpose & Overview
  AWS Secrets Manager securely stores, rotates, and manages credentials, API keys, database passwords, and tokens.
  Eliminates the need to hardcode secrets in source code, Lambda functions, or configuration files.
  Integrates natively with RDS, Redshift, DocumentDB, and external databases for automated secret rotation.
  Provides fine-grained IAM access, encryption with AWS KMS, and audit logging via CloudTrail.
  💡 Secrets Manager = centralized, encrypted, auditable credential management.

🔒 2️⃣ Security Configuration Best Practices
  Encrypt all secrets with customer-managed KMS keys (CMKs) — avoid using the default AWS key for high-sensitivity workloads.
  Enable automatic rotation (30–90 days) for all credentials where possible.
  Never hardcode secrets in EC2 user data, Lambda, or environment variables — fetch dynamically.
  Restrict IAM permissions:
    Only applications/services should have secretsmanager:GetSecretValue.
    Admin users can manage metadata but not view secret values.
  Enable CloudTrail logging for all API calls (GetSecretValue, PutSecretValue, RotateSecret).
  Use VPC Endpoints (Interface Endpoints) for private, internal access — avoid public Internet exposure.
  Apply resource-based policies to control cross-account access.
  Tag secrets (App, Environment, Owner, RotationEnabled).
  💡 Security = encryption + least privilege + audit.

🧩 3️⃣ Secret Lifecycle & Rotation Best Practices
    Enable automatic rotation using AWS-provided Lambda rotation templates:
      Supported for RDS, Aurora, Redshift, and DocumentDB.
      Custom rotation Lambdas for non-AWS databases or APIs.
    Set rotation intervals:
      High-risk credentials: 15–30 days.
      Standard secrets: 60–90 days.
  Test rotations in staging before production rollout.
  Use CloudWatch alarms for failed rotations.
  Store rotation Lambda code in a versioned repo (GitHub/CodeCommit) for auditability.
  Keep previous versions of secrets for rollback (Secrets Manager retains versions).
  💡 Rotation = automated, monitored, reversible.

⚙️ 4️⃣ Access Control & IAM Policies
  Use least-privilege IAM policies — no wildcard actions.
  Use IAM conditions to restrict access:
    aws:SourceVpce
    aws:PrincipalTag
    aws:RequestTag
  Create separate roles for rotation and retrieval.
  Integrate with IAM Identity Center (SSO) for human access to sensitive secrets.
  Regularly audit IAM roles with access to secrets via AWS Config and Access Analyzer.
  Prohibit developers from managing production secrets directly.
  💡 IAM = fine-grained, scoped, and auditable.

🧠 5️⃣ Integration with AWS Services
  | **Service**                           | **Purpose**                                          |
  | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
  | **Lambda / ECS / Fargate**            | Fetch database/API credentials securely at runtime   |
  | **RDS / Aurora / Redshift**           | Automated password rotation via native integration   |
  | **EC2 / EKS / App Runner**            | Inject secrets dynamically at startup or deploy time |
  | **CloudFormation / CDK / Terraform**  | Provision and manage secrets as code                 |
  | **KMS**                               | Encrypt secrets at rest                              |
  | **CloudWatch / CloudTrail**           | Monitor and audit secret usage                       |
  | **Secrets Manager + Parameter Store** | Hybrid model (static vs. dynamic values)             |
  💡 Integration = full lifecycle automation + runtime security.

📊 6️⃣ Monitoring & Auditing
  Enable CloudTrail for secretsmanager.* API events.
  Stream CloudTrail logs to S3 / CloudWatch / SIEM (Splunk, Datadog).
  Enable AWS Config rules:
    secretsmanager-rotation-enabled-check
    secretsmanager-secret-periodic-rotation
  Create CloudWatch alarms for:
    Rotation failures
    Unused secrets (>90 days)
    Unauthorized access attempts
  Use AWS Security Hub integration to consolidate findings.
  Review secret usage logs monthly.
  💡 Visibility = detect misuse before compromise.

🧱 7️⃣ Multi-Account & Multi-Region Strategy
  Centralize Secrets Management in a security or shared services account.
  Share secrets across accounts securely via resource-based policies.
  Use cross-account IAM roles for apps that need access.
  Replicate secrets across Regions for disaster recovery.
  Use AWS Organizations SCPs to enforce mandatory encryption and rotation.
  Tag secrets consistently across accounts.
  💡 Enterprise strategy = centralized management + cross-account governance.

🧮 8️⃣ Compliance & Governance
  Integrate Secrets Manager with Audit Manager for evidence generation.
  Map usage to compliance frameworks:
    PCI-DSS (Section 3.5 – key & secret protection)
    ISO 27001 (A.10 – cryptographic controls)
    HIPAA (PHI protection)
    NIST 800-53 (SC-28 – protection of information at rest)
  Enable Config + CloudTrail + KMS integration for end-to-end compliance traceability.
  Run quarterly compliance reviews for secret rotation, tagging, and IAM access.
  💡 Compliance = continuous + automated + reportable.

🧰 9️⃣ Automation & DevSecOps Integration
  Provision secrets via IaC (CloudFormation, Terraform, or CDK).
  Inject secrets dynamically in CI/CD pipelines (e.g., CodeBuild, CodePipeline).
  Use EventBridge rules to trigger automatic alerts for expired or failed rotations.
  Use Systems Manager Parameter Store for non-sensitive config values — keep Secrets Manager for sensitive ones only.
  Rotate credentials automatically on deployments (Lambda or ECS).
  Use GitHub Actions or Jenkins integrations to fetch AWS secrets securely (OIDC federation).
  💡 Automation = secure pipelines + no plaintext secrets.

💸 10️⃣ Cost & Performance Optimization
  Store only sensitive data in Secrets Manager — use Parameter Store for simple configs.
  Avoid excessive versions (max 100 per secret) — prune old versions.
  Consolidate secrets by app or environment.
  Set automatic rotation frequency smartly (30–90 days) to balance cost and compliance.
  Monitor AWS Cost Explorer for Secrets Manager usage spikes.
  Use lifecycle policies for stale or orphaned secrets.
  💡 Optimization = minimal versions + smart rotation + hybrid use with Parameter Store.

⚠️ 11️⃣ Incident Response & Recovery
  Immediately disable or delete compromised secrets.
  Rotate all dependent credentials instantly via automation.
  Notify Security Hub / GuardDuty for correlation.
  Run AWS Lambda workflows to re-deploy apps with new secrets.
  Use CloudTrail event history for forensic investigation.
  Review resource-based policies for abuse.
  💡 Response = detect, rotate, and restore quickly.
