üåê Core Compute & Networking
  1) EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud): Virtual servers, AMIs, instance types, autoscaling.
  2) Elastic Load Balancer (ELB): Distributing traffic across instances.
  3) VPC (Virtual Private Cloud): Subnets, routing tables, NAT gateways, peering, security groups.
  4) Route 53: DNS, domain registration, routing policies.
  5) ECS / EKS / Fargate: Container orchestration and serverless containers.
  6) Lambda: Serverless compute functions with triggers.


üóÑÔ∏è Storage & Databases
  1) S3 (Simple Storage Service): Buckets, lifecycle policies, static site hosting.
  2) EBS (Elastic Block Store): Block storage for EC2.
  3) EFS (Elastic File System): Scalable file storage.
  4) RDS (Relational Database Service): Managed SQL databases.
  5) DynamoDB: NoSQL key-value store.
  6) Aurora: High-performance managed relational DB.


üöÄ CI/CD & DevOps
  1) ECR (Elastic Container Registry): Container image storage.
  2) CodePipeline / CodeBuild / CodeDeploy: CI/CD automation.
  3) CloudFormation / CDK (Cloud Development Kit): Infrastructure as code.
  4) Elastic Beanstalk: Easy app deployment service.
  5) App Runner: Simplified container app deployment.


üîí Security, IAM & Monitoring
  1) IAM (Identity and Access Management): Roles, policies, MFA, least-privilege access.
  2) KMS (Key Management Service): Encryption keys.
  3) Secrets Manager / Parameter Store: Secure configuration management.
  4) CloudWatch: Metrics, logs, alarms.
  5) CloudTrail: API activity auditing.
  6) GuardDuty / Security Hub: Threat detection and monitoring.


üì° Messaging & Integration
